                  Eager to uncover the deepest darkest secrets of the world with her beloved sister, Rectangle always leaves a trail of happiness and excitement wherever she goes!... But, she is starting to boast a darker side, as a spark of imagination she had in "Shapeoff 4: Mind the Gap" led her to scheming a blueprint for an underground facility built to torture Shapelanders alike. Hopefully that never comes to fruition.

                <li>Rectangle had an epiphany in "Shapeoff 4: Mind the Gap" while Hexagon and Triangle were dueling. She found the sheer violence of the fight to be entertaining and now hopes to recreate that in the future.</li>
                <li>Rectangle enrolled her sister into Circle's school for her.</li>
                <li>In the original series' Episode 7, Rectangle is shown without arms in a flashback. This was before she turned 10 and grew them.</li>
                <li>Rectangle often forgets where she is because she gets too mesmerized in what she's doing.</li>

                  Oval's story begins with him being born into a poor family, which means he has worked harder than most shapes in the Shapelands. While he used to be quite the cheerful one as a kid, he's since grown a lot more monotone the more he realized how hard of a hand life dealt him, specifically centered around the death of his older brother in a freak accident. Oval's specialty in being a mechanic was inspired by his sibling, dying doing what he loved most. Oval cares a lot about Pentagon, as he sees him as the brother he longed to have once more. Oval's a hard-working person, and even though he's fallen multiple times, he's always gotten back up.

The only shape he has a strongly positive relationship with is Hexagon, as they share a sibling-like bond with each other.
