Her personality is also quite… explosive, explaining her mutual respect with Hexagon.

A hobby Pentagon's developed recently is having a real knack for Shapelandish history. He also has a hidden talent in engineering, being able to make new and innovative things from the parts around him. He just hasn't figured it out yet.

              <h3>📜 Backstory</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Hexagon was born into a mafia family as an only child. She was expected to be the next heir in her parents' operations.

                <li>One fateful day, Hexagon's parents figured that she was ready to go on one of their missions to a sketchy and dangerous part of the Shapelands. The family trudged on with caution, but that was not enough, and they were swarmed with old rivals, out for their blood.</li>
                <li>Hexagon returned home, carrying the burden that was the absence of her parents. She hid in a bush to conceal herself, but at the cost of her family. Ever since, she's been wanting to get revenge on the world for taking her parents away by using what they had taught her.</li>

                  Decagon used to be a rather chaotic shape, causing small turmoil between older shapes. But, as he was setting up a prank in the forest, he tripped and fell onto a strange golden lamp. Before he could get up, a giant boulder crushed him against all odds, destroying his body and somehow infusing his soul within the golden lamp. He then soon figured out that he could grant wishes to people, so he waited until Octagon found him in "Shapeoff 2: Artistic Ambitions".
